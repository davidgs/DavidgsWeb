# Why the Beans?

People are always asking me about the Coffee beans on this site. Am I a Barista? Am I just really into coffee? What? If you look through this site for a while, you'll notice that I have been involved with the Java Programming Language and Java Technology since, well, since just a little bit before Java was actually released by Sun Microsystems, Inc. back in 1995 (has it really been that long? I feel old now all of a sudden!).

Subtle? Maybe a bit too. But that's the reason behind the coffee (Java) beans! Now you know.

That being said, I do love me some coffee! Here's a little compilation I did of my home made Lattes over the course of a month, just for fun.
