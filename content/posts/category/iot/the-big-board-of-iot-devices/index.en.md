Just for future reference, here’s the development board that sits on my desk:

![Tot 1 2](/posts/category/iot/images/Tot-1-2.png)

What’s on it? Well, here’s the list:

- [Intel Edison](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html): One on the (mostly useless) Intel Mini Breakout board and one on a Sparkfun Block (more on this one in a later post)
- [Electric Imp](https://electricimp.com)
- A couple of [Arduinos](https://www.arduino.cc) — they’re actually [RFDuinos](http://www.rfduino.com), which I backed on Kickstarter.
- A [Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io)
- A [NodeMCU](http://nodemcu.com/index_en.html)
- Some random sensors I’m working with.

Not shown (because they’re not really bread-board friendly: A Raspberry Pi and some Sun SPOTs. I’ve written about almost all of these elsewhere, so I won’t detail it all here now.

All of this is hooked to my bench power-supply — 3 channel, so I can run different devices off of different power rails on the board — my trusty Oscilloscope and my logic analyzer for all the debugging I need.
