What is the Internet of Things (IoT)  anyway? And what makes up the IoT ecosystem? Yes, IoT is the buzzword of the year. Yes, everyone thinks everything is IoT these days. But just because a thing connects to the internet doesn’t mean it’s IoT.

In thinking about this idea, I put together the following presentation, of sorts. It’s HTLM5, and can take a while to load, but check it out and let me know what you think in the comments section.

**Please note:** The DHTML viewer can, on occasion, be a bit finicky. If you get an error page, please go back, and reload. I’m looking into the problem. If the DHTML Player truly fails -- or if you're using Chrome, which has abysmal HTML5 support, you can watch the presentation as a video below. Keep in mind that the timings are a bit off in the video version, so pause/rewind may be your friend.
