I'm working on this massive IoT project this quarter (you can [read about it](/posts/category/camunda/iot-project) if you're interested) which is going to be a big hardware build, lots of software, and a bunch of [Camunda Platform BPMN](https://camunda.com?ref=davidgsiot). I've never really live-streamed before because, you know, who wants to watch me do stupid stuff?

## Live Stream!

My friend [Rain](https://twitter.com/rainleander) was starting to dabble in IoT hardware and software, so I offered to show her what I was doing, and a livestream was born!

We've decided to go live every Friday at 8:30am EDT and bang away at this hardware and software build. Here's our current schedule:

| Date | Topic | Link |
|------|-------|------|
| April 4, 2021| Hardware building | [replay](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1005977038) |
| May 7, 2021 | Software for a sensor | [watch live](https://twitch.tv/davidgsiot) |

| May 21, 2021 | Software Hacking | [watch live](https://twitch.tv/davidgsiot) |
| May 28, 2021 | Hardware Hookups | [watch live](https://twitch.tv/davidgsiot) |
| June 4, 2021 | Software Tricks | [watch live](https://twitch.tv/davidgsiot) |
| June 11, 2021 | Hardware build | [watch live](https://twitch.tv/davidgsiot) |
| June 18, 2021 | Software again! | [watch live](https://twitch.tv/davidgsiot) |

We will take a break for the week of June 25th while I go lie on a beach, and I'll post a new schedule after that.

## We're super popular

On our first livestream we had a grand total of 0 (zero, nil, nada, no one) watching, but we've had a few folks go watch the replay. So feel freem to come watch us goof around and do some basic IoT stuff.
