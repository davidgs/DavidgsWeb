I was blogging quite regularly here for some time, and suddenly not so much. Why is that? Well, if you follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davidgsIoT), or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/davidgsimmons), you’ll know that as a result of (well, sort of) a couple of my recent blog posts (specifically [this one](/posts/category/iot/iot-hardware/running-influxdb-on-an-artik-520/) and [this one](/posts/category/iot/iot-hardware/influxdb-on-artik-520-redux/)) I was hired as the Senior Developer Evangelist at [InfluxData](https://influxdata.com). And I have to say, it’s *awesome*. Really. Fantastic company. Amazing people to work with. Really cool product — and yes, a database can be an IoT product. 

But again, where are all the blog posts? Well, they’re over at [InfluxData](https://influxdata.com/blog), of course! Here’ I’ll even give you a list of them:

- [Building a Better Telegraf Plugin (Still for Beginners)](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/building-better-telegraf-plugin/)
- [How to Write A Telegraf Plugin for Beginners](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/how-to-write-telegraf-plugin-beginners/)
- [Using InfluxDB and NODE_RED to Bring Your Data to Life](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/bring-your-data-to-life/)
- [Finding the Hidden Gems in Your Data: An IoT Demo](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/building-iot-time-series-demo/)
- [The InfluxData Blog Challenge](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/influxdata-blog-challenge/)
- [Why an IoT Guy Joined InfluxData](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/iot-guy-joined-influxdata/)

So you see, I have been extremely busy blogging away, just not here. I’ll try to cross-post more often in the future, in case anyone still comes here to read stuff. :-)
