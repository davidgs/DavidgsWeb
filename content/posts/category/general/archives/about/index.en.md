# Archival posts

Over time I have written a *lot* of content for a variety of employers, publishers, etc. and, while those folks may (or may not) still have that content available I wanted to make sure that I preserved it here for myself. I have a lot of content that I am proud of and I want to make sure that I can find it again.
