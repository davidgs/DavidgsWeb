We here at InfluxData have a thing about Time to Awesome™. So much so that we Trademarked it. No, seriously, we did. And we mean it. So let’s go from Zero to Awesome!

> We are singularly focused on reducing the Time to Awesome, we truly care about helping developers and businesses get to results faster with less complexity and less code.

That’s directly from the About section of our website and we really do mean it! But just in case, I decided to test it out (again). I actually wrote a whole blog post about how easy it was to set up InfluxDB a while back, but I thought I’d do it again, just for fun. This time, I thought I’d provide proof of how easy it is, and how fast!

## The Set Up

I have my trusty MacBook Pro on which I do just about everything, so that’s what I’m going to install it on. Here’s what I’m working with:

I installed and configured InfluxDB, Chronograf, Telegraf and Kapacitor, and set up a quick system-monitoring dashboard to keep track of some system stats, all in under 5 minutes.

## Here's the proof

## Here's how I did it

```bash

Davids-MacBook-Pro:~ davidgs$ brew services start influxdb
 ==> Successfully started `influxdb` (label: homebrew.mxcl.influxdb)
Davids-MacBook-Pro:~ davidgs$ brew services start telegraf

```

That’s it! A total of 7 commands. 3 to install the entire TICK stack – because Chronograf has a dependency on Kapacitor, so it gets installed automatically – and 4 to start all the services and make sure they start across reboots.

It just doesn’t get any more simple than that! Add the small number of clicks to build the dashboard and you have an amazingly short Time to Awesome™!
