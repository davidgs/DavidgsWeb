In case you haven’t heard about it yet, there is going to be a large virtual IoT Conference this year called [IoT Slam ’15](http://iotslam.com). If you haven’t submitted a topic for a session yet well, it’s too late. The Call For Papers closed last week. I thought about submitting a topic, but I was just too busy with engineering work, at the time, to pull it off. As you know, all that [changed](/posts/category/work/a-shock-to-the-system/). And then the conference organizers called and asked me to do an invited talk, so it looks like I’ll be speaking at it after all!

It’s a virtual conference, which means there’s no need for a travel budget, so make sure and [register](http://iotslam.com/register-now) to attend! It’s December 9th, 2015, all day, but remember, you don’t have to leave your desk! 

Hope to “see" you all there!
