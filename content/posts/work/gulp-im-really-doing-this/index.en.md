Well, as you [know](/posts/work/a-shock-to-the-system/), I have been in the market for a new job lately. **Really** bad timing to be looking for a full-time gig what with the holidays, the end of many companies’ fiscal years, etc. Great timing. 

I decided it was time to take the bull by the horns, so to speak, and do something about it myself So I have co-founded Dragonfly IoT, a full-service IoT company. You can check out our new [website](https://dragonflyiot.com/) (some slick HTML5 slinging involved there, if I do say so myself!) for a little bit more about us. In a nutshell, we do Internet of Things (IoT) hardware, software, and complete IoT solutions. 

“But I don’t need an IoT solution” you say? I disagree. It’s amazing how many people I talk to that have a specific business problem to which they see no solution. I do. I see an IoT solution.

A friend of mine designs Senior Care centers, assisted living facilities and the like. We were talking recently about some of the problems she’s trying to solve in her designs — problems of managing the facility in an unobtrusive and efficient manner, problems of caring for the residents in gentle, non-intrusive ways that maximize their safety without burdening them or the staff — and she had very few solutions from which to choose. I laid out some IoT-based solutions for her that would meet all of her needs, and more. I hope we get to work together on implementing some of them soon. 

Which brings me to this: If your company — or really anyone you know — might be interested in our offerings please be so kind as to give us a referral! I have a short runway here and I **really** want to make this work!
