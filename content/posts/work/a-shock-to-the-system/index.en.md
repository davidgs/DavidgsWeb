Well that was a bit of a shocker!

As you may or may not know, I’ve been working as the Chief Technology Evangelist for a startup called [PsiKick](http://www.psikick.com) for the past 7 or 8 months. They have some pretty amazing technology for potentially making the Internet of Things battery less. It’s a great company, with great, and **really** smart, engineers. We were doing some great things, and starting to gain some traction. I was having a blast doing all sorts of stuff from porting an [SPI library](http://github.com/davidgs/) for [FTDI Chips](http://ftdichip.com/) to Mac OS X, to building iOS demo apps, to (attempting to) define a developer platform strategy.  

But then came the shock. Suddenly last week I was informed that my services were no longer needed and I was let go. Wow. Took me a minute to get my bearings again, and to figure out what was going on. It’s not the first time a company’s business direction and needs have changed and left me out. Probably won’t be the last. It’s how the world works, is it not? 

Business priorities change. Sometimes a company is just not in the right place, at the right time. 

So once again I’m looking for another amazing opportunity in the IoT space. If you’ve read through my [website](https://davidgs.com/) you know that I’m a pioneer in IoT having been working on IoT since before there really was an IoT. That would be [Project Sun SPOT](http://www.sunspotdev.org/), which Oracle killed a year or so ago. I’m at least helping keep that community alive a little bit by running the new site. It’s funny that after all these years, I still get contacted on a regular basis by Sun SPOT users that are still using that technology and are looking for support. 

So if your company is serious about engaging the developer community in growing your IoT engagements, you should call me. I’ve got over a decade of experience in driving developer engagement in the IoT. I’ve got an “infectious enthusiasm” for the IoT and the near-limitless possibilities it can enable. But please, let’s only talk if you’re serious about listening, and taking action, on engaging a developer community and moving forward, quickly. If you aren’t interested in hearing — and implementing — a serious, possibly game-changing strategy, we’d both end up frustrated. I’ll say things you might not want to hear, but as [history has proven](/posts/category/iot/whos-going-to-drive-iot-innovation/) again and again, I’m often right. And I’ll implement. I’ll built things, using your platform, to show what’s possible. It’s what I do.

So let’s get started on making the IoT a reality for your business!
