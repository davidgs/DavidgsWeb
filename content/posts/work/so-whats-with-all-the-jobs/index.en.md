If you’ve been following along lately, you’ll notice that a bunch of stuff has been happening with me. First, I [lost my job](/posts/work/a-shock-to-the-system/), Then I [started a company](/posts/work/gulp-im-really-doing-this/), [Dragonfly IoT](https://dragonflyiot.com/), and made myself the CTO of it (because I could, you know). And yesterday I was [appointed the new CTO](https://www.chimeraiot.com/chimera/default/leadership) of another startup, [Chimera IoT](https://www.chimeraiot.com/chimera/default/index). So that’s a lot of jobs, and a lot of CTO jobs, for just one person. And yet I’m *still* looking for a job??!! Well, yes.

Here’s why:

The Dragonfly IoT job is my own company. I’m doing consulting, and IoT development, for other folks. I did land a nice contract, which I’m about to finish up, and I’m really happy about that. I’ve been spending time with my former Sun Microsystems Mentor discussing the possibility of launching our own IoT hardware and SDK, and that would be a great thing to do, ultimately, but without funding, it’s a stretch. And without something to show to potential investors, getting funding is an even bigger stretch. If you have some IoT development work for me, please do reach out and let’s discuss your project!

The Chimera IoT CTO job is a huge opportunity for me as well. It’s a very exciting company, with a truly innovative approach to deploying IoT into a completely untapped market. No, I’m not going to tell you what it is. It’s part-time, and for the foreseeable future, uncompensated. As in no pay. As in it doesn’t pay the bills. It may, someday, but for now, I still have kids, and a mortgage, and bills to pay. And boundless energy!

I’ve caught the start-up bug. I want to do things that make a difference in the world. I want to contribute wherever and however I can. And yes, I am willing to work 18 hours a day, at as many jobs as it takes, to make a difference. So yes, I’m **also** looking for a ‘real’ job. And no, you shouldn’t be worried that if you hire me you won’t get my full attention, dedication, and commitment. I *never* do a job half-way. Any job. I never have. That’s not how I’m wired.
