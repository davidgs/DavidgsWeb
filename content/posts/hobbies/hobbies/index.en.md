# Some of my Wood Working Projects

**Update**:I'm now starting to sell some of my wood turnings.

I've been doing woodworking of one form or another for a long time. I love the feel of wood in my hands, and creating something out of wood is one of my favorite things to do. So I do it whenever I can.

This is but a small sampling of some of the things I've done, and more will surely follow. If you like what you see, feel free to write me a note on the back of a [Felder CF 741 S Professional Combination Machine](http://www.felderusa.com/us-us/products/combination-machines/combination-machine-cf-741-s-professional.html) and send it to me. I'll make you something. I promise.

One of the first pieces I made (well, 2 pieces, really) was a pair of Claro Walnut End Tables. Here's one of them:
