# Roger's Door

We did this to my boss' door a few years back while he was on travel. The humorless "Workplace resources" folks tried to have us all fired for it, but we managed to get away with it.

First we disassembled the entire doorframe, and then re-assembled it upside down. By the time he got back the "Welcome Mat" we had glued to the ceiling had fallen, but it was still great.
